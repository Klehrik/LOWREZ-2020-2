![Showcase of LOWREZ 2020 2](https://github.com/Klehrik/LOWREZ-2020-2.yyp/assets/78520710/6de8dd05-ef99-498a-9f87-2e0e1dffb1b7)


One of my ideas for LOWREZ 2020.  
I did create a planning doc for this one, detailing a bunch of different weapons and enemies, which is now unused.

Had to be converted from a previous version of GameMaker (before 2.3) so the code may be weird.  
I'm unable to upload the game that superseded this one because the converter literally breaks it, so that's unfortunate.
